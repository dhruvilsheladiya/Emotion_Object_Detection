# ----- Emotion Object Detection With Voice Feedback -----

# ObjectDetection
Emotion & Object Detection with Voice Feedback. 

A Python-based real-time emotion and object detection system using YOLO, DeepFace, and OpenCV, with text-to-speech feedback.

This project utilizes computer vision and machine learning to detect:

âœ… Faces & Emotions (using DeepFace)

âœ… Objects (using YOLOv8)

âœ… Colors of detected objects

âœ… Real-time Voice Feedback (using pyttsx3).

Detected data is stored in a CSV file, and an analytics system visualizes trends in detected objects, colors, and emotions.

âœ¨ Features

ðŸ”¹ Real-time face detection using OpenCV

ðŸ”¹ Emotion classification (happy, sad, angry, etc.)

ðŸ”¹ Object recognition via YOLOv8

ðŸ”¹ Color detection for objects

ðŸ”¹ Text-to-speech feedback with customizable voices

ðŸ”¹ CSV logging of detected objects, colors, and emotions

ðŸ”¹ Data analysis & visualization with Matplotlib

# How To Run:- 

1. Go to data_analysis.py file 
2. Run python data_analysis.py
3. Run python main_face.py 

# Expected Output:- 
 "happy": "You are smiling!",
 "sad":   "You look sad!",
 "angry": "You seem angry!",
 "surprise": "You look surprised!",
 "neutral": "You look neutral!"
